We have created four ready examples for you to get started. 
You can test those examples and learn how to create a service, add some security and protect it, use the same service with different tenants and apply different access controls on your service.


##Installation
Install soajs.examples before you can run the examples.

```sh
$ npm install soajs.examples
```

You are now ready to visit each example and run it.
